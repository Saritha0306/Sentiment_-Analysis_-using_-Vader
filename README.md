## Introduction

This project performs sentiment analysis on text data using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool. VADER is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool designed to work well with social media text, making it a useful tool for analyzing sentiment in short, informal text such as tweets and comments.

## Features

- Analyze sentiment in text data.
- Determine sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral).
- Calculate a sentiment compound score for an overall sentiment assessment.
- Works well with short, informal text.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

To install the required Python libraries, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use the compound score to determine the overall sentiment:
Positive sentiment: compound score >= 0.05
Negative sentiment: compound score <= -0.05
Neutral sentiment: -0.05 < compound score < 0.05
For more detailed usage and customization options, refer to the VADER documentation.
